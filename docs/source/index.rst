Welcome to ElfinHost's documentation!
===================================

ElfinHost is an access-control protocol for decentralized file hosting. It is designed for the authors, the audience and CDN/NaaS providers. The authors use smart contract to program who can and how to access the contents, and CDN/NaaS providers build neutral channels, through which mass multimedia content can be delivered smoothly from the authors to the target audience. 

ElfinHost links the authors and audience directly and frictionlessly, without any intervention or censorship.

ElfinHost help CDN/NaaS providers serve more customers and support brand-new use cases, which will bring them more earnings. Besides file access control, ElfinHost can also enable NaaS providers to act as cross-chain oracles.

No access control, no ownership. In the Web3.0 era, ElfinHost is an important infrastructure to bring data ownership back to the creators and users.

.. note::

   The ElfinHost protocol is still under active development. The documention here is not stale now.
